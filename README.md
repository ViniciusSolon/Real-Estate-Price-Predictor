# Real Estate Price Predictor

This project is a simple web application that predicts the price of a property based on its area. It utilizes a linear regression model built with Scikit-learn and is deployed using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

## Project Overview

The **Real Estate Price Predictor** allows users to input the area of a property and receive a predicted price based on a linear regression model trained on a dataset of area and price.

## Key Features
- **User Input:** Allows users to input the area of a property directly through the Streamlit interface.
- **Price Prediction:** Provides a real-time prediction of the property's price based on the inputted area.
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface:** Built with Streamlit to ensure ease of use and accessibility.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input:** The user inputs the area of the property.
2. **Model Prediction:** The linear regression model predicts the price based on the inputted area.
3. **Output:** The predicted price is displayed on the screen.
